# One Day at Bootcamp

As materials are created for the "One Day at Bootcamp" events hosted by Metis,
we should keep them well organized in a single area. This repo can act as that
hub. 

#### Organization

Every module should get a sub-folder named after it's intention. Example:

```
intro_to_python_and_regression 
```

Inside of this folder, there should be *2* sub-folders and a README:

```
--> intro_to_python_and_regression 
|
-------> student_version
|
-------> instructor_version
|
-------> README.md
```

This organization scheme will allow us to keep neat order to our materials and make it easy for other instructors to
pickup and reuse your materials at a later date.

##### Student Version

This section should contain all slides and notebooks that a student will
receive. Any exercises that are "left to the student" should be unsolved in
these versions by default.

##### Instructor Version

These should be the same as the student version, but all exercises should have
a solution included. The idea is that any instructor can pick up these
materials and teach them - so we must provide solutions they can draw from.

##### README

This will talk about the purpose for each notebook (briefly) and what order to
present the notebooks in. All notebooks should also have a section in the
README that highlights "what ar  the most important take-aways" such that a
new instructor knows where to spend their effort and teaching time. 

## Organization of Materials

Inside each folder, all the materials should be labeled in such a manner:

```
1_intro_to_python.ipynb
2_intro_to_regression.ipynb
...
```

The numeric system will help future instructors to keep track of which
notebook should occur when, during the presentation.
