# Intro to Python

The point of this "One Day at Bootcamp" is to bring in beginner level students
and help them get on their journey to data science (hopefully by joining
Metis). This module is made up of 3 notebooks. 

#### 1_intro_to_python.ipynb

This is the first notebook. It is designed to teach the fundamentals of Python
to students - starting with 'hello world', printing, variables, lists, tuples,
etc

The notebook has a plethora of material. This is the bulk of the lecturing for
this course - so take your time and hit it well.

*Estimate: 1.5 - 2 hours for this notebook with a novice class*

#### 2_python_exercises.ipynb

This notebook is full of exercises for the students to attempt on their own.
However, you should encourage them to work with their neighbors. There are
easy problems to start with, and some much more advanced problems for them
to deal with if they speed ahead. This is all about hands on learning and you
can read the room on how much time this will need.
*Estimate: 30-45 minutes for this notebook, +15 minutes for solutions*

#### 3_python_pair_project.ipynb

This final notebook has the students build out a small project: a word counter
for text data. It starts simple, but has several extra challenges for more
  advanced students to attempt. I recommend you split the students into pairs
  and let them work together to attempt to build something that works well. If
  you have time at the end, feel free to have some folks volunteer to show off
  their solutions
*Estimate: 30-45 minutes for this notebook, +15 minutes to show solutions*


## Material Distribution

The best practice we've found so far is to ZIP the student folder (after
adding any manipulation you want for your specific time teaching) and placing
the zip file onto a Google Drive. The students are then sent the "how to
install" document which you can add the a link to. The document is in the repo
as an example. 

## Goal Take-aways

- Basic proficiency with python (white spaces, variables, lists, for loops)
- Some time practicing using python in a setting where they can begin to see
how it works and what they can use it for. 
- A small project that counts the words in a document or file. 

## What to watch for...

- WINDOWS. Most students in this class have Windows machines, make sure you
know how to troubleshoot Anaconda in Windows. For example, to launch it you
must open the Anaconda Launcher/Navigator from the Start Menu and leave the
DOS window it opens running. Otherwise the kernel is dead.
- Don't underestimate the amount of time you'll need to get everyone setup.
People will have problem downloading things. Not everyone comes prepared.
- The notebooks will take way longer than you think (and probably even longer
than my estimates, depending on how interactive your class is). Sacrifice the
end material for the beginning material.
